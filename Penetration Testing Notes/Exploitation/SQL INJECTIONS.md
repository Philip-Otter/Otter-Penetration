### Attack Tuning
	Two parts to every payload
		Vector
			Carries the useful SQL code
		Boundaries
			Prefix and suffix that enxapsulates the vector
#### Level and Risk
- --level 
	- Defines the boundary and vector values to use
		- 1-5 options 
			- default of 1
		- Prioritizes most likely values first
- --risk
	- 1-3
		- default of 1
		- Control the risk for data loss or denial of service
### Technique Characters
- B
	- Boolean-Based Blind
- Error-Based
	- Union Query-Based
- Stacked Queries
- T
	- Time-Based  Blind
- Q
	- Inline Queries 


### Help Menus
- -h
	- Basic help
- -hh
	- All options and help
- Official wiki also has the full manual 

### Useful Flags
- -u
	- provide the target URL
- --batch
	- Skips any required user input by automatically choosing the default option
- -r
	- Provide SQL map with a request file
		- contains http request
- --cookie
	- Specify cookie
- -H
	- enter a header value
	- Headers can be tested use `*` to indicate where to test
- --Host
	- set host
- --referrer
	- set referrer
- -A / --user-agent
	- specify the user agent to work
- --random-agent
	- randomly selects a user agent
- --mobile
	- Imitate a smartphone
- --data
	- POST request
	- Also defines POST data
- --method
	- Specify http method
- --dump-all
	- Grab all database information
- --dump
	- Grab just the goodies 
- --parse-errors
	- Includes DBMS errors in the output
- -t 
	- Store the whole contents of the traffic to an output file
- --prefix and --suffix
	- Used to manually set the prefix and suffix
- --title
	- Used for title comparison during an attack

### Useful Commands
- Reading Dumped DBs
	- ==Command:==  Column -s, -t < {file}.csv | less
		- Can be kinda janky
		- Often better to just query data through sqlmap itself after all the data has been dumped to local files
# Types Of SQL Injections
***
## Boolean-Based BlindSQL Injections
***
	Retrieves 1 byte of information per request
	True or False is determined through server responses
	Most common SQLi in web applications
## Error-Based SQLi
***
	Uses DBMS errors to carry query results
	Can get 200 bytes of information per request
## Union Query Based SQLi
***
	Extends another query
	Fastest SQLi
		In the right scenario it can pull the whole contest of a database with a single request
## Stacked Queries
***
	Piggybacks off of the vulnerable query 
		Can be used to run OS commands and retrive data 
## Time Based SQLi
***
	Boolean values based on response times
	Slower than boolean based blind
## Inline Queries
***
	Embeds a query inside of another query
	Uncommon
## Out Of Band SQLi
***
	Runs on the DNS Server
		Requests non-existent subdomains to form the SQL response
