# Types Of SQL Injections
***
## Boolean-Based BlindSQL Injections
***
	Retrieves 1 byte of information per request
	True or False is determined through server responses
	Most common SQLi in web applications
## Error-Based SQLi
***
	Uses DBMS errors to carry query results
	Can get 200 bytes of information per request
## Union Query Based SQLi
***
	Extends another query
	Fastest SQLi
		In the right scenario it can pull the whole contest of a database with a single request
## Stacked Queries
***
	Piggybacks off of the vulnerable query 
		Can be used to run OS commands and retrive data 
## Time Based SQLi
***
	Boolean values based on response times
	Slower than boolean based blind
## Inline Queries
***
	Embeds a query inside of another query
	Uncommon
## Out Of Band SQLi
***
	Runs on the DNS Server
		Requests non-existent subdomains to form the SQL response
