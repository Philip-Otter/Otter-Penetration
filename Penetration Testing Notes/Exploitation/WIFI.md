# Cracking WPA /WPA2
***
## MIC
***
	4 way handshake
	MIC = Message integrity check
	Used by an AP to verify that each packet ahs not been compromised
### Converting Capture
- cap2hashcat online
	- https://hashcat.net/cap2hashcat/
- hashcat utils
	- ./cap2hccapx {inFile}.cap {outFile}.hccapx
## PMKID
	Pairwise Master Key Identifier
		AP's unique identifier for keeping track of pairwise master key
	This allows us to attack the AP directly
	Found in the first packet of the four-way handshake 
	Calculated with HMAC-SHA1
		PMK is used as a key
- Composed of 
	- wifi password (PMK)
	- AP MAC Address
	- "PMK Name" (String)
	- Station MAC Address
### Extracting PMKID
- hcxtools
	- hcxpcaptool 
		- Obsolete
	- hcxpcapngtool
		- ==Syntax:==  hcxpcapngtool {inFile}.cap -o {outFile}
